# Literals


literal is a language-independent programming term. A literal is a
succinct and easily visible way to write a value. For example, you 
could construct the value zero with int(), but 0 is much more convenient.

In Python, the following literals are available:

- Character string literals, such as `'Düsseldorf'`, `u'Köln'` (the first one is a byte string literal in Python 2.x)
- Byte string literals such as `b'\x89PNG'`
- Integer literals such as `-12`, `98`
- Float literals such as `1.2e-19`, `3.14`
- Complex literals such as `1+2.3j`
- Boolean literals: `True` and `False`
- Special: `None`
- Tuples: `(1, 2, 3)`
- Lists: `[1, 2, 3]`
- Dicts: `{1: 'one', 2: 'two'}`
- Sets: `{1, 2, 3}`
